# Palms-ballroom-client-user

## Description

- Palms Ballroom is a web-based application that provides a ballroom directory and booking services.
  We believe this project can be impactful in Indonesia, due to the wide market and high demand for ballrooms for events. What sets us apart from the competition is our user experience and security. We offer a 3D ballroom for a better user experience in booking services, and we also use facial detection payments for enhanced security due to the high cost of the ballroom.

- TL;DR: AirBnb/traveloka for ballroom hotels in Indonesia (currently active in 5 cities: Jakarta, Bali, Surabaya, Bandung, Yogyakarta)
